# weighlifting-plate-quantity-calculator

A simple weight calculator program that calculates the number of weight plates needed for a given weight. It was designed for use with the imperial pound (lb), instead of the metric kilogram (kg).

## Description

The weight calculator is a lightweight Java program that helps determine the number of weight plates required for a desired weight. It allows users to input their desired weight and calculates, for each side of the bar, the number of weight plates needed for each plate size commonly used in weightlifting.

## Features

- Input a desired weight in pounds (lbs)
- Exception handling for input not divisible by 5 or less than 45 lbs.

  - 45 lb plates
  - 25 lb plates
  - 10 lb plates
  - 5 lb plates
  - 2.5 lb plates
- Displays the quantity of each plate size needed per side
